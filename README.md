Directories and Files Management System
This project implements a Directories and Files Management System, which allows users to efficiently manage and organize a set of directories and files 
in a tree hierarchy structure. The system utilizes various data structures, such as the tree data structure to represent the hierarchy of directories, 
the queue data structure to store a queue of files pending for creation following FIFO, 
the linked list data structure to store files within each directory, and the stack data structure to provide the go back functionality.

The system also provides a well-visualized way to display the tree of directories and allows for easy navigation and the ability to add, 
rename, and delete directories and files.
It also tracks the user's navigation history to make it easy for the user to go back to previous directories.


Features
*Tree data structure to represent the hierarchy of directories
*Queue data structure to store a queue of files pending for creation following FIFO
*Linked list data structure to store files within each directory
*Stack data structure to provide the go back functionality
*Well-visualized way to display the tree of directories
*Easy navigation between directories
*Add, rename, and delete directories and files
*Track the user's navigation history to make it easy to go back to previous directories

Usage
To use this Directories and Files Management System, you can simply clone the repository and run the program.
The program allows the user to perform various operations on directories and files such as adding, renaming, deleting, and navigating between them.
The user can also display the tree of directories to see the hierarchy of the directories and their sub-directories.
